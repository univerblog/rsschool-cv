### About Me:

I started doing web development in 2014 when I designed my first website in Photoshop. Then I did the layout myself in HTML and CSS. Since then I have been doing web development.

I really enjoy designing and solving problems in JS. I really want to participate in the development of interesting projects, and work in a team with interesting people.

I am sure that I will succeed, and with your company my skills will grow significantly. I hope that I will benefit people with my knowledge.

### Code example:

**Bouncing Balls kata from CODEWARS:**

A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. The height of this floor, h, is known.

He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window (including when it's falling and bouncing?

**Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:**

* Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
* Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
* Float parameter "window" must be less than h.

```javascript
function bouncingBall(h,  bounce,  window) {    
    if (h > 0 && bounce > 0 && bounce < 1 && window < h) {
        var exp = 0;
        while (h > window) { 
            h = (h * bounce);
            exp++;
        }
        return (exp * 2) - 1;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }  
}
```
